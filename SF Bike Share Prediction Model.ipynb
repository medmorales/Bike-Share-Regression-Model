    "# San Francisco Bike Share Prediction Model \n",

    "I have done a previous analysis on bike share data of San Francisco where I extracted trends and patterns from the data. I found a different set of ride share data that that has a few new columns, which will come in handy when creating a prediction model. I want to create a model that will predict how many bike rides are taken on a daily basis, as a continuation of the analysis. Highly recommed taking a look at it, https://github.com/medmorales/Data-Exploration/blob/main/Lyft%20Analysis/BikeShareAnalysis.ipynb.\n",

Therefore, I will look into removing them prior to running the model. I am going to continue looking at the different data thats available, but will be thinking about my options for these outliers, maybe reducing the amount of outliers by creating a cutoff.
